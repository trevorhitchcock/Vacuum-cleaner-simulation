# Vacuum-cleaner-simulation
An automatic vacuum cleaner simulation! This was created for part of my CSI-350 class at Muhlenberg College.

This program simulates a vacuum cleaner in an environment.\nThere are three different experiments we have programmed.\nExperiment 1: The program is run 100 times in an environment that is 50% dirty. The agent gets 75 moves to clean as much as it can.\nExperiment 2: The environment is the same as before, but the agent moves randomly in the environment instead of up, down, left, or right.\nExperiment 3: The environment is the same as in experiment one, except there is a 'child' moving around dirtying the environment.
